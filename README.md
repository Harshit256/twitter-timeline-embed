Twitter has become a standard social media channel for most online brands and Twitter feeds have become increasingly popular on websites. This tutorial aims to teach you how to add some styles to your website's Twitter feed.  In order to use this tutorial you will need to navigate to your Twitter account and pull the code for your embeddable widget. Once you have done that we will use HTML and CSS to style the widget to match our own branding. We will explain every change along the way, beginning with Twitter's original embed widget code.
